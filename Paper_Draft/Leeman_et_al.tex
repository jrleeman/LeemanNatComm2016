\section{Introduction}
Observations of slow-slip and low-frequency earthquakes in nature suggest that
fault failure encompasses a spectrum of slip modes \cite{Peng:2010, Ide:2007,
Beroza:2011}.  While the explanations for non-traditional earthquakes remain a
topic of debate, they have been observed in many subduction zones, including
Cascadia \cite{Miller:2002, Rogers:2003}, Mexico \cite{Kostoglodov:2003}, Costa
Rica \cite{Jiang:2012}, Japan \cite{Ito:2006}, and New Zealand
\cite{Wallace:2010}. What causes strain energy to be released across a
wide-range of failure behaviors is not understood, and is made more difficult by
the limited methods of observation on natural faults. Laboratory stick-slip is
often used to model and study repeating earthquake behavior \cite{Brace:1966,
Johnson:2013}. Frictional stability of a system is predicted to bifurcate at a
critical stiffness , $k_c$ \cite{Gu:1984}. For systems in which $k>k_c$,
linearly stable response is exptected, while systems with $k<k_c$ are
dynamically unstable \cite{Scholz:2002}. Behavior at and near $k_c$ is not well
understood, but transitional behaviors such as sinusoidal stress variations and
slow-slip have been observed \cite{Kaproth:2013, Baumberger:1994, Leeman:2015}
Here we show that critical stiffness is not a fixed parameter, but evolves with
shearing until the material is pushed through a transitory region of condition
stability into traditional fast, stick-slip behavior. We demonstrate stable,
slow-slip, and stick-slip behavior in the laboratory by modifying the aggregate
shear stiffness of the system.

\section{Main}
Biaxial double-direct shearing experiments were performed with humidified
Min-U-Sil\textsuperscript{\textregistered} simulated fault gouge. Force and
displacement are recorded on both axes, as well as a measurement of the shearing
block position (Fig.\ref{Fig:Biax Schematic}). System compliance can be modified
by changing the normal stress (2,4,6,8,12 MPa) or the material of which the
shearing block is made (steel or cast acrylic).

System stiffness measured in cycles of unloading and reloading the shear stress
provide an estimate of aggregate stiffness for all experiments regardless of
failure behavior. Stiffnesses recovered from the loading portion of individual
stick-slip events show very low stiffnesses during early frictional oscillations
and emerging slow-slip due to the non-static nature of the system. These values
of “working stiffness” do not represent the overall stiffness of the system, but
a stiffness influenced by continued slip and creep. As dynamic failure reaches a
steady state, we see agreement between the two methods of stiffness measurement
(Fig.\ref{Figure:stiffness_comparison}).

Experiments performed under stiff system conditions exhibited linearly-stable
behavior in response to order of magnitude velocity perturbations.
Linearly-stable response is characterized by direct matching of the loading and
system velocities and a transitory frictional response. Experiments of identical
conditions, but in a more compliant system exhibited emergent unstable behavior,
beginning with frictional oscillations, and transitioning to dynamic frictional
failure. Oscillations and dynamic failure are characterized by relatively rapid
accelerations and decelerations of the system above/below the load point
velocity when the material yields under excessive shear force. Experiments with
further increased compliance exhibited very rapid dynamic failure that was
audible and classified as fast stick-slip.

For experiments exhibiting stable sliding behavior, velocity steps were imposed
to obtain the rate-and-state frictional parameters of the material and system.
The rate-and-state parameters are constants to an emperical fit to transient
response of a frictional system to a perturbation \cite{Marone:1998}. The $a$
parameter provides a measure of the direct effect in response to a velocity
step, and $b$ provides the magnitude of friction evolution there-after. The
difference of $a$ and $b$, then yields a quantitative measure of how strongly
velocity strengthening or velocity weakening a material is. The critical slip
distance, $D_c$, is often considered to be the slip required to renew the
contact population in a granular material. In our experiments, $a$ remains
relatively constant with displacement, but $b$ evolves asymptotically upwards
with increasing shear displacement. During this transitional period, the
critical slip distance evolves downwards (Fig.\ref{Figure:RSF Props}).

       constant with displacement and shows a systematic behavior with higher

The transition from velocity strengthening to velocity weakening and
corresponding decrease in $k_c$ increase the value of the predicted critical
stiffness (eq.\ref{equation:kc}). When the critical stiffness intersects the
measured system stiffness, we begin to see frictional oscillations and dynamic
failure. The larger the departure from $k=kc$, the more dramatic the behavior.
Very stiff systems show no tendency to produced damped oscillations after a
velocity step. Very compliant systems exhibit fast dynamic failure. (Fig.
\ref{Figure:Runplot})

There are two conditions for unstable behavior to occur: 1) that the material be
velocity neutral to velocity weakening, and 2) that the system stiffness be at
or below the critical stiffness \cite{Marone:1998, Scholz:2002}. Velocity
weakening is a necessary, but insufficient condition for unstable behavior. If a
material is velocity strengthening, any acceleration leading to slip is
immediately arrested by increased shearing resistance and the energy is
frictionally dissipated. The stiffness of the system governs the rate at which
energy stored as strain can be released. If the energy release occurs in such a
way that the drop in shear resistance with displacement occurs faster than the
drop in applied shearing force with displacement, the system can support
unstable failure.

Increases in measured aggregate system stiffness from layer compaction due to
grain rearrangement, layer thinning with increased shear strain, possible grain
comminution and increased packing, localization of shear, and reduction of
compliant center block material above sample due to geometric effects with
shear. Layer compaction due to rearrangement and geometric thinning with shear
have been well documented \cite{Scott:1994}.  At these low stresses, grain
comminution is minimal. Shear localization effects does play a role in the
evolution of layer behavior \cite{Logan:1992}. The reduction in the amount of
compliant center block material above the shearing zone with accumulated
displacement is minimal compared to these other effects.

Our observations of transitional behavior beginning when $k \sim k_c$ suggests
that $k_c$ is a valid proxy for the stability of a system, marking a transitory
zone between stable sliding and stick-slip that encompasses slow-slip and
oscillatory behavior. We also observe that the critical stiffness of a system
evolves with shear strain, suggesting that tectonic faults may change behavior
as they accumulate slip and become mature fault zones.

Laboratory results can also be connected to observations in nature through the
critical patch size. Critical patch size (eq.\ref{equation:rc}) grows with
increasing $k_c$ and/or increasing normal stress. Extending this to large patch
sizes hypothesized for slow-slip events, and assuming a nominal shear modulus
($G$), suggests lowered normal stress, possibly due to high pore-pressures
and/or low critical stiffness values.

% Equation - Critical Radius %
\begin{equation}
    r_c = \frac{16}{7\pi}G \frac{D_c}{\sigma_n (b-a)}
    \label{equation:rc}
\end{equation}

\section{Methods}
All experiments were performed on a servo-controlled biaxial shearing apparatus.
Displacements on the normal and shearing axes were measured by Direct Current
Displacement Transducers (DCDTs) referenced at the end-platens and ram nose. The
displacement of the shearing block was measured with a DCDT referenced at the
end-platen and the top of the shearing block. Loads applied to the sample were
measured with strain gauge load cells. All transducers are semi-annually
calibrated with a traceable transfer standard.

Samples were prepared in the double-direct-shear geometry using steel or
titanium side blocks and steel or acrylic shearing blocks. All blocks were
grooved 0.8 mm deep at 1 mm spacing to reduce boundary effects. The sample area
was 10 x 10 cm and filled with Min-U-Sil to a thickness of 3 mm. Granular layers
were left in a sealed container overnight with a solution of anhydrous sodium
carbonate to humidify the samples.

After samples were loaded into the load frame, a constant normal stress was
applied and maintained by the servo system in a force feedback control mode.
Samples were allowed to compact and accomodate grain rearrangement before
shearing began. Shearing is conducted at a fixed rate in displacement feedback
control mode.

Stiffness of the system was altered by changing the applied normal stress and by
changing the material of the shearing block. Increasing normal stress decreases
the effective stiffness of the system, as does switching the steel forcing block
for a cast acrylic block.

Layers were built of Min-U-Sil\textsuperscript{\textregistered} 40 fine ground
silica from the U.S. Silica\textsuperscript{\textregistered} company Berkeley
Springs, West Virginia plant. The median diameter of grain is 10.5 $\mu m$. The
product is 99.5 \% SiO$_s$, with traces of metal oxides making up the remainder.

System stiffnesses from unload/reload shear stress cycles were calculated by a
least-squares linear fit in friction vs. displacement for the interval $\mu =
0.3-0.4$. Stiffnesses from the loading portion of slow-slip and stick-slip
events were obtained with a derivative based algorithm \cite{Leeman:2015}.
Rate-and-state models were fit with both the Dieterich and
Ruina laws, with comparable results. Inversions were done with an iterative
singular value decomposition technique.

Stiffness Short Article
=====================

Development of a paper on stiffness and critical stiffness for submission
to a peer-review journal. Nature Geoscience?

## Chris/Demian Actions and Questions
- Edit title suggestions (90 char. max with spaces)
- Look at reference list
- Do we want to make the figure of the biax B&W only to save on printing?
- Do we want to make the RSF parameters figure B&W to save on printing?
- Begin draft review

## How to Review with Git
- Make a new branch and check it out: ex. *>> git checkout -b cjm_edits*
- Do your edits to the files. Please don't change the line wrapping as it makes diffs harder to look at
- Save the files
- Check the changes git sees: *>> git status* The files should be listed under **modified**.
If there are other files listed or problems, let me know.
- Add and commit the changes *>> git commit -am "Your commit message"*
- Push to the remote repo *>> git push origin cjm_edits*
- Done! (Don't forget to switch back to your master branch if you want!)

## Remaining Experiments for This Article:
- Acrylic center (fine tooth, thick) at 4 MPa Normal Stress with
unload/reload cycles

## List of Supplemental Material
- Raw Data
- Table of experiments
- Table of RSF step fits

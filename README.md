Stiffness Short Article
=====================

Development of a paper on stiffness and critical stiffness for submission
to a peer-review journal. Nature Geoscience?

## Remaining Experiments for This Article:
- Acrylic center (fine tooth, thick) at 4 MPa Normal Stress with
unload/reload cycles
- Repeat all conditions with 2 DCDT Setup
- Measure stiffness of center block when clamped between side blocks at
different displacements to see how much itâ€™s compliance changes.
- For experiments with fast stick-slip record the audio
(Tom from acoustics offered to lend me some really nice and
SPL calibrated measurement microphones)

## Questions:
- Discuss the 6MPa experimental stiffness results

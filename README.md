Development of a paper on stiffness and critical stiffness for submission

## How to Review with Git
- Make a new branch and check it out: ex. *>> git checkout -b cjm_edits*
- Do your edits to the files. Please don't change the line wrapping as it makes diffs harder to look at
- Save the files
- Check the changes git sees: *>> git status* The files should be listed under **modified**.
If there are other files listed or problems, let me know.
- Add and commit the changes *>> git commit -am "Your commit message"*
- Push to the remote repo *>> git push origin cjm_edits*
- Done! (Don't forget to switch back to your master branch if you want!)

# PAPER TITLE

## Introductory Paragraph (typically 150 words, unreferenced)
Observations of slow-slip and low-frequency earthquakes in nature suggest that
fault failure encompasses a spectrum of slip modes. While the explanations for
non-traditional earthquakes remain under debate, an ever increasing pool of data
shows them to be found across the globe in a variety of tectonic settings.
Tribology suggests that a system will become unstable at a critical stiffness
value, but transitional behavior around this stiffness boundary has remained
poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate the spectrum of failure modes from
stable-sliding to stick-slip in a frictional laboratory system with simulated
quartz fault gouge. When operating near the  critical stiffness, slow-slip
events are observed. Our results show the critical stiffness to be the
controlling factor for slip mode, itself influenced by environmental factors
such  as pore pressure and second order frictional properties of the gouge.

## Results

Biaxial double-direct shearing experiments were performed with humidified
Min-U-Sil simulated fault gouge. Force and displacement are recorded on both
axes, as well as a measurement of the shearing block position (Fig.??). System
compliance can be modified by changing the normal stress or the material of
which the shearing block is made (steel or cast acrylic).  

Experiments performed under stiff system conditions exhibited linearly-stable
behavior in response to order of magnitude velocity perturbations.
Linearly-stable response is characterized by direct matching of the loading and
system velocities and a transitory frictional response. Experiments of identical
conditions, but in a more compliant system exhibited emergency unstable
behavior, beginning with frictional oscillations, and transitioning to dynamic
frictional failure. Oscillations and dynamic failure are characterized by
relatively rapid accelerations and decelerations of the system above/below the
load point velocity when the material yields under excessive shear force.
Experiments with further increased compliance exhibited very rapid dynamic
failure that was audible and termed “fast-stick-slip”.

System stiffness measured in cycles of unloading and reloading the shear stress
provide an estimate of aggregate stiffness for all experiments regardless of
failure behavior. Stiffnesses recovered from the loading portion of individual
stick-slip events show very low stiffnesses during early frictional oscillations
and emerging slow-slip due to the non-static nature of the system. These values
of “working stiffness” do not represent the overall stiffness of the system, but
a stiffness influenced by continued slip and creep. As dynamic failure reaches a
steady state, we see agreement between the two methods of stiffness measurement.

For experiments exhibiting stable sliding behavior, velocity steps were imposed
to obtain the rate-and-state frictional parameters of the material and system.
The a parameter provides a measure of the direct effect in response to a
velocity step, and b provides the magnitude of friction evolution there-after.
The difference of a and b, then yields a quantitative measure of how strongly
velocity strengthening or velocity weakening a material is. The critical slip
distance, Dc, is often considered to be the slip required to renew the contact
population in a granular material. In our experiments, a remains relatively
constant with displacement, but b evolves asymptotically upwards with increasing
shear displacement. This means that the material transitions from velocity
strengthening to velocity weakening. During this transitional period, the
critical slip distance evolves downwards.

An examination of the requirements for unstable behavior reveals two suggested
conditions: 1) that the material be velocity weakening, and 2) that the system
stiffness be at or below the critical stiffness. Velocity weakening is a
necessary, but insufficient condition for unstable behavior. If a material is
velocity strengthening, any acceleration leading to slip is immediately arrested
by increased shearing resistance. The stiffness of the system governs the rate
at which energy stored as strain can be released. If the energy release occurs
in such a way that the drop in shear resistance with displacement occurs faster
than the drop in applied shearing force with displacement, then the system can
support unstable failure.

Critical stiffness, described in eq. ??, will evolve upwards based on the
results of our velocity step inversions. When the critical stiffness intersects
the measured system stiffness, we begin to see frictional oscillations and
dynamic failure. The larger the departure from k=kc, the more dramatic the
behavior. Very stiff systems show no tendency to produced damped oscillations
after a velocity step. Very compliant systems exhibit fast dynamic failure.
(Fig. ??)

These results suggest that stiffness is a first-order predictor of the
frictional stability of a system.

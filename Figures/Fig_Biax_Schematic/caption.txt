The biaxial deformation apparatus (A) and sample configuration (B). Two large
hydraulic pistons are servo-controlled in either force or displacement control
modes. Double direct shear samples are supported by steel blocks. Samples use
metal side shields and a plastic membrane to reduce gouge extrusion.

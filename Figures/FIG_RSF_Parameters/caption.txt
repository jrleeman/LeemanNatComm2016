Figure Caption
Rate-and-state friction parameters obtained from velocity step inversions. All
inversions were accomplished with a fixed stiffness of 5.5e-3/um. A) rate-and-state
parameter a remains relatively constant with displacement and shows a systematic
behavior with higher values of a always being observed during velocity
up-steps. The b parameter shows a similar behavior, but also increases with
displacement, reaching a steady-state value around 10 mm displacement.
B) The sample transitions from velocity strengthening to velocity weakening
 behavior at around 10 mm and remains velocity weakening for the remainder of
 the experiment. C) Critical slip distance estimates show considerable scatter,
 but do reduce to a steady-state value of 5-10 um.

Figure Caption
A) Run-plots of experiments p4309 (blue), p4311 (orange), and p4316 (green).
Different working stiffnesses can be observed as the slope of unload/reload
segments. B) All steel blocks produced stable responses to velocity steps.
C) Destiffening the system with an acrylic center block produced non-audible
slow-slip events. D) Further destiffening with an acrylic center block and
increased normal stress produced audible fast stick-slip events.

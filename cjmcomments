We need a clean, complete experiment.  Figure 1, or some version of it, can be an inset to that. The current Fig. 1 would go in supp. materials

Fig 2, or 1b, should focus on time series showing the emergence of slow stick-slip and the details of it. This fig. will emphasize the observation(s) and the resolution of our measurements –proving that we see flow slip and that we have stable, clean measurements. 

Replace Fig. 2a with a fric. displ. curve showing vel. step –or just omit 2a.  Figs 2b and 2c show the main story.

Fig 4 is too busy; data are noisy.

Fig 5 needs annotations. We need to clean up the estimates of Kc.
